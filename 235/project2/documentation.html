                <p>Deviant Art helped me in finding images to use for a tab icon. The Pikachu head used is by Twin-Gamer.</p>

                <p>
                    PokeAPI is the API I'm using to create this web app service. All information on the Pokemon loaded in come from this API. Compared to other versions of
                    the "Pokedex" app I've seen, some definitely had minimal infomation and sometimes incorrect data passed in. When grabbing data from each entry, I made
                    sure to locate exactly where the code should look for the info from each Pokemon's URL so no wrong information gets passed in, and to style the info so
                    the user is given explicit and aesthetic detail on the Pokemon. My web app, while not perfect, I would say is definitely better some others I have seen
                    with simple search controls, stylish data, and better error handling.

                <p>
                    Both Serebii and Bulbapedia helped me to confirm statistical information given about each Pokémon from PokeAPI. Bulbapedia also helped to provide images
                    for the shiny Pokemon star from Pokemon Stadium 2 and the decamark icon used as a placeholder image for Pokemon with no image available. On topic with the
                    shiny Pokemon star, there is a small feature for this app where it secretly rolls a number from 1 to 4096 and will show a shiny Pokemon sprite with the
                    shiny star next to their name if the number is 2 or less, which corresponds to the shiny rate in Pokemon games being 2/4096.

                <p>
                    Only one font is used here, but I originally grabbed 2 and played around with them:
                    <p><a href="https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/pokemon-fire-red" target="_blank">Pokemon Fire Red Font by KaelinT</a> and

                <p>Stack Overflow helped me to figure out specific complex functionality in Javascript and CSS.</p>

        Looking back on the work I've made, it wasn't easy to make this or find assets for any extra features I have for it. I also had to abandon some original ideas 
        for the sake of functionality, simplicity, and time. In the end it came out great and I'm proud of it. I'd say this is deserving of an A.
