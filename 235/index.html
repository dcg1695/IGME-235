        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <header>
            <p>Hey guys! My name is David Green and I'm from Yonkers, NY. One of my hobbies is playing video games (you know GDD majors teehee), but another one of my
               hobbies, that's also my favorite, is singing and music. I love to sing whenever I get the chance to, despite me not being good at it. Music, including pop,
               anything PTX, etc., has definitely helped me with feeling more confident and expressive with myself. I've always loved video games, mainly interactive dramas,
               story-based games, and RPGS, and I've always wanted to know how such games are constructed. During the time that I'm at RIT, I want to be able to learn what
               making games entails, from the mechanics to the story to characters and actual gameplay. Each aspect of building a game is so important, especially the
               programming, and I also want to really hone my skills and excel at programming. From this class, I want to know what goes into building sites and understand
               a lot about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            </p>

        <h2>A Quote from Yours Truly</h2>

        <p>This is just a special message that I like to remind myself of sometimes, and I thought it might be nice to share with you guys.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Wouldn't you know that your path was there all along waiting for you to knock, waiting for you to become. This path does not belong to your parents, your
            teachers, your peers, your leaders. Your path is your character defining itself more and more every day, like a photograph coming into focus.
