                    <h2>Game Design student looking for a summer Co-op</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a second-year Game Design and Development student at RIT. It’s really great when I can become part of a team and blend our ideas together to
                        create an amazing story, game, and experience that can appeal to many people. My primary skills are coding and web design, in which they're shown
                        through my skills in C#, Unity, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can also do 3D modeling in Maya and a little bit of pixel art.

                <p id="workInfo">
                    This is a desktop browser-based survival shooter made using Javascript, PixiJS, and HTML/CSS where the player must ward off an incoming group of
                    enemies using the power of harmony bullets. You gain new types of bullets every level and must use certain ones to take out certain enemies. When
                    making this game, it helped me get a better understanding of what you can do with PixiJS and understanding switches for what to display and when. One
                    of the biggest challenges here was moving the character smoothly with keyboard control. It was a good idea to implement but was also a struggle to
                    get working properly.

                <h4 class="t2"><a href="https://people.rit.edu/dcg1695/235/project2/">Pokémon Finder</a></h4>
                <p id="workInfo">
                    This is a simple Pokémon finder/Pokedex app that I made using Javascript, HTML/CSS, and the Pokémon API. It takes user input from any type of search
                    and displays the information on a Pokémon of their choosing, from their stats to their abilities to their movesets. Working on this app helped me
                    understand how results are grabbed from an API after being requested and shown to the user. A special feature of this app is that there is a small
                    chance for the app to a Pokémon in its shiny form whenever the user searches for one, similar to the shiny odds in the games. A pretty major challenge
                    was getting information from the API to load, but I worked through it by carefully following paths to the information and adding informative placeholder
                    text for the user when a request returned nothing.

                <h4 class="t3"><a href="https://people.rit.edu/dcg1695/235/phrases/random-phrases.html">Random Danganronpa Phrases</a></h4>
                <p id="workInfo">
                    This is a random phrase generator that I made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This generator gives a cool greeting when it's first loaded up, and then
                    it allows the user to press the button at the top of the page and get any popular or famous phrase from the Danganronpa series. The phrases used in this
                    generator I chose because I thought that they were either funny or thought-provoking quotes. It also has a cool background image of the three main
                    protagonists from the series, yet to make the image the background of the page took some trial-and-error and a little help. It was a lot of fun to
                    make this small project since it helped me learn about event listeners in scripts and how to make them go off to do something else, as well as give
                    me an opportunity to make something about one of my favorite anime/game series.
